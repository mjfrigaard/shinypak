\title{List Branches of the shinyAppPkgs Repository}
\usage{
list_apps(regex = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{regex}{An optional character string containing a regular expression
(regex) to filter branch names}
}
\value{
A tibble with three columns: 'source', 'branch_name', and 'updated',
listing the source of the branch, the branch name, and the last updated
date.
}
\description{
This function clones the 'shinyAppPkgs' GitHub repository, extracts the list
of branches along with their last update time, and then returns this information
as a tibble. The repository is cloned to a temporary directory, which is removed
after the function executes.
}
\section{How it works}{

The function operates in several steps:
\enumerate{
\item It saves the current working directory to revert back to it later
\item It clones the \href{https://github.com/mjfrigaard/shinyAppPkgs}{'shinyAppPkgs'}
repository from GitHub into a temporary directory
\item It lists all branches of the cloned repository
\item It separates the branch \code{name}s into \code{source} and \code{branch_name}
\item It cleans up by deleting the temporary directory and restoring the original
working directory
}

Note that the function currently does not use the \code{regex} parameter to filter
branches. This parameter can be implemented in future versions to allow branch
filtering based on regular expressions.

list_apps()
list_apps(regex = "tests")
