# `shinypak`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The primary goal of `shinypak` is to provide easy access to the applications in [`moviesApp`](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/moviesApp), the example application for the [Shiny App-Packages](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/shiny-app-pkgs/) book. 


`shinypak` also has functions for checking the files and folders in a Shiny app-package. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `shinypak` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mjfrigaard/shinypak")
```

```{r}
library(shinypak)
```

## Git/GitHub configuration

`shinypak` uses the [`gert` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/gert/) for Git/GitHub management (and assumes authentication was done automatically using the `credentials` package).[^credentials]

[^credentials]: Check out the documentation for the [`credentials` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/credentials/articles/intro.html)


## Available app-packages

The example applications are stored in the [branches](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/moviesApp/branches/all) of the `moviesApp` repo. To see a list of the available app-packages, use `list_apps()`[^all-apps]

[^all-apps]: Each of the apps in `shinypak` have a corresponding chapter in [Shiny App-Packages](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/shiny-app-pkgs/) and branch in the [moviesApp repo](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/moviesApp/branches/all).


```{r list_apps, eval=TRUE}
list_apps()
```

## Launching apps and app-packages

Launch an application from any section in the book using:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
launch(app = "02.3_proj-app")
```

```{r launch, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/launch_readme.gif")
```
