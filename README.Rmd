# `shinypak`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The primary goal of `shinypak` is to provide easy access all the application examples in [`sap`](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/sap).[^all-apps]

[^all-apps]: Each of the apps in `shinypak` have a corresponding chapter in [Shiny App-Packages](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/shiny-app-pkgs/) and branch in the [sap repo](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/sap/branches/all).

`shinypak` also has helper functions for checking the files and folders in a Shiny app-package. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `shinypak` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) after installing `remotes`:

```{r remotes, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', eval=FALSE}
install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("mjfrigaard/shinypak", force = TRUE)
```

```{r pkg, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(shinypak)
```

## Git/GitHub configuration

`shinypak` uses the [`gert` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/gert/) for Git/GitHub management (and assumes authentication was done automatically using the `credentials` package).[^credentials]

[^credentials]: Check out the documentation for the [`credentials` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/credentials/articles/intro.html)


## Available app-packages

The applications in `shinypak` are from the chapters of the [Shiny App-Packages book](https://bit.ly/ShinyAppPkgs). A full list of the available apps and topics are available in `topic_lookup`:


```{r head-topic_lookup, eval=TRUE}
knitr::kable(
  head(topic_lookup, 10)
)
```

```{r tail-topic_lookup, eval=TRUE}
knitr::kable(
  tail(topic_lookup, 10)
)
```


## Launching apps and app-packages

Launch an application from any section in the book using:

```{r , eval=FALSE}
launch(app = "02.3_proj-app")
```

```{r launch, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/launch_readme.gif")
```
